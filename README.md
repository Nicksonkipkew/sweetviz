Sweetviz Analysis Report README
Overview
This README provides a brief explanation of the code that generates an analysis report for a dataset using Sweetviz library. The code loads a dataset, generates an analysis report using Sweetviz, and saves the report as an HTML file.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

sweetviz
pandas
You can install these dependencies using the following command:

Copy code
pip install sweetviz pandas
Code Explanation
The provided code performs the following steps:

1. Import Required Libraries
python
Copy code
import sweetviz as sv
import pandas as pd
This section imports the necessary libraries: sweetviz for generating analysis reports and pandas for working with data.

2. Load the Dataset
python
Copy code
dataset_path = "heart_2020_cleaned.csv" 
data = pd.read_csv(dataset_path)
Here, the code loads the dataset from the specified CSV file path (heart_2020_cleaned.csv) using pandas' read_csv function.

3. Generate Analysis Report
python
Copy code
report = sv.analyze(data)
This line generates an analysis report using the analyze function from Sweetviz, passing the loaded dataset (data) as an argument.

4. Save the Report as an HTML File
python
Copy code
report_path = "report.html"
report.show_html(report_path)
The code saves the generated analysis report as an HTML file named report.html using the show_html method of the report object.

Running the Code
To run the code:

Make sure you have the required libraries installed (see Prerequisites).
Replace "heart_2020_cleaned.csv" with the path to your dataset CSV file if necessary.
Run the script.
Output
After running the script, an analysis report will be generated and saved as an HTML file named report.html. This report provides insights into the dataset's characteristics and relationships between its variables.

Additional Notes
Sweetviz offers various customization options for analysis reports. You can explore the Sweetviz documentation for more information on customization and usage.
